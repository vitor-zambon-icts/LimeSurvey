Captcha Extended Change Log
===========================

Version 1.0.3 Feb 19, 2021
---------------------------
- fixed compatability issues for PHP 7.4+ (e.g. imagecolorallocate accepts only valid range 0-255)
- fixed calculation of centered position for text inside image
- added support for parameter "regenerateOnValid", default TRUE
- optimized some default settings e.g. font size, number of lines or dots density

Version 1.0.2 Sept 19, 2013
---------------------------
- bugfix: skip captcha counter incrementation if clientajax validation is turned on. Otherwise captcha code would be silently invalidated after entering as many form fields as the number of allowed captcha attempts.

Version 1.0.1 July 01, 2012
---------------------------
- fixed client-side validation that generated incorrect validation hash

Version 1.0.0 August 29, 2011
